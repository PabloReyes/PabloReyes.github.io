I am a web developer. 

I've been a tech-guy since the Y2K bug, when I thought computers were safe enough. I discovered programming at the age of 14, with a really bad C book. Since then, I have been discovering and learning new things every single day, and I always have at least one or two projects on my hands, in which I work every time I have some free time.

I love creating new things by myself, but I strongly agree with the Convention over Configuration design paradigm and the DRY principle. I think they not only make the development phase faster, but also make things more robust and easier to debug.
