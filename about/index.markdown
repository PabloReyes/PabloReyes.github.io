Hi, my name is Pablo Reyes and I am from the sunny Andalucia, Spain. I started my Computer Science studies there and continued them
in Stuttgart, Germany. At the moment I'm living in Barcelona, which I can tell you it's an amazing city.  

I have been programming since I was a child and I have tried and worked with countless languages and technologies, and although I love learning new technologies, I try to focus on solving problems and educating more than mastering individual technologies or languages.

I share my interest in finance with my current job in the fintech industry. I'm interested in mobile payments, stock market, virtual currencies and basically the future of finance in a connected world.
