AngularJS Ninja, SpringMVC Magician, Lambdas Expert, and other meaningless job titles showing your lack of abilities.

Anyone that consider himself a good programmer has read at least some of the most important books in the history of software development: The pragmatic programmer, Code Complete, The Mythical Man-Month, Head First Design Patterns, etc. Most of these books haven't found yet a worthy replacement after the most intensive 20 years of software development. How is that possible? How come it's difficult to see any new book on any "Top 10 books for Software Developers" list? The answer is simple: We are more interested in the new technologies that come up every year than the actual basic principles that serve to create and use these technologies in the best possible ways.

We are acquiring customs that were always related to business people, politicians and other people that need to sell themselves instead of their work. Extensive use of fuzzy words, stupid job titles, unbelievable curriculums, etc. The idea that a "Software Engineer" won't make it through your interview process because he is not a React Ninja has not only grown deep in the HR departments and archaic companies, it's been established as a de-facto part of the culture in startups and young developers, which sometimes are more interested in mastering the latest technology than to solve real problems and challenges.

>consider how often we see software projects begin with adoption of the latest fad in architectural design, and only later discover whether or not the system requirements call for such an architecture. Design-by-buzzword is a common occurrence. At least some of this behavior within the software industry is due to a lack of understanding of why a given set of architectural constraints is useful. In other words, the reasoning behind good software architectures is not apparent to designers when those architectures are selected for reuse. -Roy Thomas Fielding

It may be because I started programming at a very early age when all this fancy javascript frameworks didn't exist, or because in my first job I was offered lot of responsibilities that led me to try everything, but I refuse to accept that this super specialization is making us developers any good. 
 
A firefighter developer solves problems, put out fires. He has the confidence to jump in to solve a problem in whatever technology he needs to, because most of the times problems do not come from the technology itself, they come from the way an application has been architectured or developed. When a problem in a production environment happens, the firefighter will evaluate what component of the application check first. He will know how to debug a frontend application, a backend application, read a server log, or optimize an SQL query. This knowledge is essential when it comes to solve a problem instead of finishing an specific task. 

Many times, an error in production is due to a bad connection string to the database, or a database table being locked, or an error in the application server configuration. Other times, an error in a web application is related to a bad use of an event-based system, or an asynchronous call to an API written by a jQuery ninja that doesn't know how promises work. 



### But we need specialists...
We do. 

We need an expert in frontend technologies that can decide whether it's better to use a event-based architecture or a state-based
architecture. He also needs to understand the implications of the fancy two-way data binding, what is an XMLHttpRequest, how do
promises work, understand gzip compression, know how to automate tasks like minifying files, understanding the life cycle of its framework components
etc.
 
But... How are they different of having a well configured Maven project, configuring Apache, ant tasks, etc

We need people that XMLHttpRequest We need engineers specialized in frontend technologies that can decide the best technology to use
and the best way to implement it. We need people that know how to get the best things from new improvements in Javascript or implement
the best tasks in Grunt to automate the boring tasks. We need people who understand
